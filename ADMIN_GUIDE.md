4. **Admin Auto-Approved**: Admin accounts are automatically approved and don't need approval

## Troubleshooting

### Admin Already Exists
If running `npm run create-admin` and admin already exists:
```
Admin user already exists!
Email: admin@example.com
```

### Forgot Admin Password or Want to Reset to Default
Use the reset admin script to restore email and password to default:
```bash
cd backend
npm run reset-admin
```

Expected output:
```
MongoDB connected
Admin user found. Resetting to default credentials...

‚úÖ Admin user reset successfully!

Admin Credentials:
Email: admin@example.com
Password: admin123

‚ö†Ô∏è  IMPORTANT: Please change the admin password after login!
```

After reset, you can login with:
- Email: `admin@example.com`
- Password: `admin123`

### User Cannot Login After Being Approved
1. Check user status in database: `status: "approved"`
2. Clear localStorage in browser
3. Login again

### Error "Access denied. Admin only"
Ensure:
1. Admin token is valid and not expired
2. Logged in user has `role: "admin"`
3. Authorization header is correct: `Bearer {token}`

### Cannot Edit User Profile
Ensure:
1. You are logged in as admin
2. The user is not an admin (admin users cannot be edited)
3. Email is unique (not used by another user)

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Password Changes**: Change admin password regularly for security
2. **Review Pending Users**: Check and approve/reject pending users promptly
3. **Verify User Information**: Verify student/lecturer information before approval
4. **Monitor User Activity**: Regularly review user list and remove inactive accounts
5. **Backup Data**: Regularly backup the database (see [DATA_PERSISTENCE.md](DATA_PERSISTENCE.md))

## Admin Profile Management

Admins can manage their own profile:
1. Click on avatar/name in navbar
2. Select "Profile" from dropdown menu
3. Update name, email, or password
4. Upload custom avatar

**Note:** Admin role and status cannot be changed through the profile page.
